            <h3>Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction</h3>
            <p>Analyzed and predicted the chances of the presence of diabetic retinopathy with data pulled from a Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Random Forest classifier.</p>
            <p>Evaluated the performance of models after using Feature Selection techniques such as Backward Search and PCA to achieve performance accuracy of 76% using LDA.</p>
            <p>Applied 3 Classification Models (LDA, KNN and SVM) for performance evaluation and concluded that SVM achieves the nest performance accuracy of 74% without feature selection.</p>
